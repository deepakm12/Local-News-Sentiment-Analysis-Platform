In response to Cyberthon'2023 problem statement: "AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis for Community Policing".

The main problem statement for building an AI-driven sentiment analysis tool for community policing is to create a system that can effectively monitor and analyze public sentiment regarding law enforcement from various sources, such as social media and local news. The system's primary goal is to help law enforcement agencies identify community concerns and public sentiment trends, allowing them to make data-driven decisions, enhance community relations, and improve their policing strategies.
